# Blog-with-recommendation-system

The project aims at building a basic webpage that can be used for reading blogs. The frontpage shows the title and icon of the site. Latest articles are shown in the first page and the user can click on any of the articles to read them.

Once the user clicks on the article, a new page opens up with the article heading, authors name, date of publishing and category of the article. This page shows an article which is generated by Llama3 and connected to the frontend via Replicate API.

The article page also shows 4 recommended articles based on the article heading.
